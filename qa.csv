"“Voters do not agree with the frequent traffic police standing in the hidden position to shoot the speed of vehicles participating in traffic, thinking that the performance of official duties must be public and transparent.","Regarding these issues, the Ministry of Public Security would like to answer, as follows:

Regarding recommendations related to measuring the speed of vehicles participating in the traffic police forces, speeding is one of the direct causes of traffic accidents.The traffic police force measuring the speed of vehicles participating in traffic, promptly detecting and handling speeders of speed to limit traffic accidents is essential.However, many drivers seeks to deal with public speed, such as: running at high speed, when detecting stations and pegs of the traffic police will slow down or avoid;The driver is sanctioned in notifying the driver who is in other traffic to avoid, making it difficult to perform the tasks of the traffic police force ... Therefore, the combination of public and secret speed is stemming from the requirements of the actual situation.

Pursuant to the Law on People's Public Security in 2014, the Road Traffic Law in 2008 and the Government's Decree No. 106/2014/ND-CP, dated November 17, 2014 of the Government defining the functions, tasks, powers and organizational structure of the Ministry of Public Security, dated January 4, 2016, the Ministry of Public Security issued Circular No. 01/2016/TT-BCA stipulating tasks, powers, forms, content of traffic patrol and traffic control;Accordingly, in Clause 1, Article 9 stipulates: ""Make up using professional technical equipment and equipment, in order to improve the effectiveness of the work of ensuring traffic order and safety"".Therefore, the traffic police force combining public measures with secrets (makeup) to measure the speed is necessary, stemming from work practices and in accordance with the law./."

People have the right to monitor and supervise activities to ensure the traffic order and safety of the traffic police force but do not have the right to ""see the document sent to go on duty or not"", because the work plan of the traffic police force is a type of professional document of the police industry, only responsible people and competent authorities are inspected.If the road participants suspected the police officer, they must notify the police at all levels to handle, including the phone number 069.2342608 (hotline) of the Traffic Police Department./."

"In the two -way roads with a hard median strip dividing the road surface into two separate cars, every afternoon there is a white line that is broken into 2 lanes in the same direction (or multiple lanes in the same direction).In the area without lane signs, no signs in each lane, such as Bich Bich Street, Tan Phu District - TP.HCM;Phan Van Hon Street, District 12, TP.HCM;National Highway 1A passing through Thong Nhat district, Dong Nai ...

So, I would like to ask, according to the current regulations, which lanes and motorcycles are circulated in lanes?(Inner lane or external lane or both lanes)?When the car in the left left lane moves slowly, will the inner lane truck move faster, will it be sanctioned for overseas violations according to Decree 171/2013/ND-CP?To drive properly, when the car in the lane moves very slowly, how to drive over?","I. Which lane is I. cars and motorcycles circulating?
- Article 13 of the Road Traffic Law stipulates:
""Article 13. Use lane
1. On the road, there are many lanes for the car in the same direction to be distinguished by lane lane lane, the driver must allow the vehicle to travel in a lane and only transfer lanes in the permitted places;When changing lanes, there must be a notice signal and must be safe.
2. On a one -way road with lane lane lines, rudimentary vehicles must go on the right right lane, motor vehicles, special -use motorbikes on the left lane.
3. Means of road traffic moving at a lower speed must go to the right. "".
- So:
For lanes with many lanes distinguished by lane lane lane line, the driver must allow the vehicle to travel in a lane and can only transfer lanes in places allowed.
For one -way roads with lane, cars, motorbikes must move in the left lane, rudimentary vehicles must move in the right right lane.

II.When the car in the left left lane moves slowly, will the inner lane truck move faster, will it be sanctioned for overseas violations according to Decree 171/2013/ND-CP?
- Point c, Clause 5, Article 5 of Decree 171/2013/ND-CP dated November 13, 2013 of the Government: ""A fine of between VND 2,000,000 and VND 3,000,000 for the driver of the vehicle to perform one of the following acts:
c) Excess in cases of overtaking prohibitions;There is no signal before passing;Over the right of the other vehicle in case of not being allowed, except for the case where there are many lanes for the car to go in the same direction, it is distinguished by lane lane lane line that the car runs on the right lane that runs faster than the car running on the left lane; "".
- Thus, drivers of vehicles are not sanctioned for exceeding the provisions of Decree 171/2013/ND-CP.

III.To drive properly, when the car in the outside lane moves slowly, how to drive over?
Drivers must comply with the regulations on speed, distance and signs, road markings, and at the same time pay attention to overcome in accordance with regulations and ensure safety."

Since 2012, the Ministry of Public Security has implemented the issuance and registration of car number plates on the computer system;The issuance of the license plate is done in the form of random dial (the system of databases registering the car is secret, through many layers of protective passwords, strictly managed) to ensure publicity, transparency and fairness for all people to register the car.

In order to serve the random dialing on the computer, the car registration units have put into the system of thousands of license plates for people to click the random number, who can click any license plate, they receive that number, not in a certain order;Therefore, there are cases where the larger number is pressed first, the smaller number is clicked later, not in the same order as before."
"Voters reflected that the family has a car owner who is the owner, other members of the family can use the vehicle and be handled under the law, suggest explanation.","At Points b, Clause 1 and Clause 4, Article 30 of the Government's Decree No. 171/2013/ND-CP, dated November 13, 2013 of the Government stipulating sanctioning administrative violations in the field of road and rail transportation, the regulations ""only sanction for individuals and organizations are owners of motorcycles, motorbikes and vehicles similar to motorcycles; car owners, tractors, motorbikes and vehicles that are similar to vehicles without vehicles.transfer the name of the car owner in the registration certificate of your name) as prescribed when buying, given, given, allocated, transferred, inherited the property is motorbike, motorbike and similar vehicles;

Thus, in the family there is a car named by the head of the car registration certificate, without buying, selling or giving, giving, transferring and inheriting this car for other members of the family, these members can still use that vehicle to participate in traffic without sanctions specified at Point b, Clause 1 and Clause 4, Article 30 of Decree No. 171/ND-CP."
"Proposing administrative procedures for registration of vehicle papers should be simpler, in order to facilitate the people to participate in registration easily.","Implementing administrative procedure reforms on registration of license plates in the direction of simplifying the process, procedures for registration conditions, transfer of names, transfer of ownership and license plates, including vehicles that have been traded many times;On March 1, 2013, the Ministry of Public Security issued Circular No. 12/2013/TT-BCA, amended and supplemented Clause 3, Article 20 of Circular No. 36/2010/TT-BCA, dated October 12, 2010, regulations on vehicle registration, guidance on registration procedures, transfer names, transfer of motorbike owners are motorcycles.

"Traffic accidents have claimed many lives, causing mourning for tens of thousands of families every year.Among many causes related to the management of traffic order and safety of the traffic police force.Voters proposed to focus on directing and strengthening patrol and handling of violations, ensuring that the functional forces strictly implement the assigned responsibilities and powers, contributing to limiting traffic accidents, stabilizing security and social order.","Over the past time, the Ministry of Public Security has focused on directing the police units and localities to mobilize forces and means of professional technical equipment to organize the guidance, propagation and law education, and at the same time strengthen patrol, control and handle violations, ensure traffic order and safety (traffic safety);On average, each year, the traffic police force has inspected, detected and handled over 5 million cases of violations of traffic order, traffic safety, and fined a fine of over VND 2,000 billion;coordinate to arrest thousands of criminals operating on traffic routes.The above results have contributed positively to restraining, reducing accidents and traffic congestion;In 2012, 2013 and the first 6 months of 2014, the number of deaths from traffic accidents was reduced to less than 10,000 people.

However, the situation of order and traffic safety is still complicated, the number of serious traffic accidents still occurs, the number of deaths and injuries is still high.The cause of the above situation is that the state management of traffic is still loose, the infrastructure system, the planning of the transport system is still inadequate, the awareness of traffic participants is still limited.

In order to enhance the work of ensuring traffic order and safety, the Ministry of Public Security focuses on directing the police and localities to continue performing the following key tasks:

- Strengthen patrol, control, use and maximum exploitation of professional technical equipment for the detection and handling of administrative violations in the field of road traffic.

- Organize peak phases, handle violations according to thematic such as: overloading violations;Violation of alcohol content when controlling the vehicle;Violating regulations on wearing helmets when riding a motorbike and motorbike;patrolling, controlling and handling violations to ensure traffic safety at rural roads ... to solve the complicated situation of traffic safety, achieving the goal of restraining, reducing accidents and traffic congestion.

- Continue to maintain and promote the effectiveness of the model of working groups between traffic police, criminal police, mobile police, police 113 ... to strengthen patrol, control and strictly handle objects, hammock, illegal racing, carrying weapons when participating in traffic and crimes operating on traffic routes.

- Coordinate with the mass media and local authorities to promote the dissemination and education of law on traffic safety and safety in order to create the consensus of public opinion and people to support the active activities of functional forces fighting against violations of traffic safety.

- Strictly handle in accordance with the law on violations of traffic safety and safety showing signs of crime, especially traffic accidents, causing serious consequences.

- Through the task of ensuring traffic safety, detecting and proposing to the authorities to overcome and resolve unreasonable in traffic organization, the risks of traffic unsafe and the ""black spots"" of traffic accidents."
It is recommended to empower the commune police force to check traffic in rural areas to contribute to reducing traffic accidents in rural areas.,"In order to enhance the task of ensuring traffic order and safety (traffic safety) in rural areas, on March 24, 2010, the Government issued Decree No. 27/2010/ND-CP stipulating the mobilization of other police forces and the commune police in collaboration with the road traffic police participating in patrolling and controlling road traffic safety in case of necessity;On July 2, 2011, the Minister of Public Security issued Circular No. 47/2011/TT-BCA, which stipulates that the commune police level participates in coordination with the traffic police force in case of necessity.On the other hand, in Article 11 of the Minister of Public Security's Circular No. 12/2010/TT-BCA dated April 8, 2010, guiding the implementation of the Ordinance on the Commune Police and Decree No. 73/2009/ND-CP of September 7, 2009, detailing the implementation of a number of articles of the Commune Police Ordinance stipulated:Participate in coordinating with the Traffic Police force to perform the task of ensuring traffic safety in the commune ... ”.

However, in order to meet the requirements of ensuring traffic safety and safety in the current situation in rural areas, the Ministry of Public Security will study amendments and supplements to Circular No. 12/2010/TT-BCA mentioned above, in order to better specify the task of ensuring traffic safety of the commune police in rural areas."
"Currently, the regulation of dossiers and procedures for identifying the faulty person in the traffic accident to be treated under the health insurance regime also makes it difficult for the people.Voters propose the Ministry of Public Security to coordinate with relevant ministries and branches to soon have specific instructions on the time, procedures and records in providing the victim's family or medical facilities that require the identification of the faulty person in a traffic accident.","The definition of dossiers and procedures for identifying faulty people in traffic accidents for treatment under the health insurance regime is carried out by Joint Circular No. 39/2011/TTLT-BYT-BTC dated November 11, 2011 of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Finance guiding the procedures for payment of medical examination and treatment costs for medical insurance participants in medical insurance in traffic accidents.
Joint Circular No. 39/2011/TTLT-BYT-BTC is chaired and coordinated with the Ministry of Health to coordinate with the Ministry of Finance.The process of building joint circulars, the Ministry of Public Security issued Official Letter No. 293/BCA-C61 dated February 14, 2011;Official Letter No. 969/BCA-C61 dated April 14, 2011 and Official Letter No. 1744/BCA-C61 dated June 22, 2011 for the draft Joint Circular to agree before signing the promulgation, but the contents are not acquired into this Joint Circular.Therefore, when applying this Joint Circular, it makes it difficult for the people and the police force, namely: At Point a, Clause 3, Article 2 of the Joint Circular stipulating ""forcing the police agency (Traffic Police, the Investigation Police Agency) to provide the social insurance enterprise or extract a conclusionThere are no specific guidance documents for the entire police force.
The Ministry of Public Security is proposing to the Ministry of Health - the Ministry of Finance in writing with the Ministry of Public Security in the implementation of this Joint Circular, from which there is a basis to guide the local police to implement.While waiting for the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security has directed the local police to provide documents related to traffic accidents according to possible capabilities such as: after 03 months, from the date the social insurance agency sends a written request for verification according to the regulations but has not received the notice of the police or receiving notice or not verifying the status of social insurance, the medical examination and treatment of the medical examination and treatment authorityThe disease has been used as for the case of an accident that does not violate traffic laws.Particularly in the field of inland waterway transport, the Ministry of Public Security is directing the authorities to develop a circular to stipulate the process of investigating and resolving water traffic accidents in the direction of simplifying administrative procedures and the investigation of the accident must be conducted quickly and promptly."
"Proposing to review regulations on penalties and compensation for damage to people who violate traffic order and safety.Because the current penalty is too light, not highly deterrent.","On April 2, 2010, the Government issued Decree No. 34/2010/ND-CP stipulating sanctioning administrative violations in the field of road transport replacing Decree No. 146/2007/ND-CP dated September 14, 2007;Compared to Decree No. 146/CP, Decree No. 34/CP has increased the fine of the fine framework for 83 violating groups specified in 83 of 25 articles, with an increase of from 50% to 150%.In particular, the pilot has been applied for a number of violations in the inner city of special cities, whereby the fine level increases from 1.3 times for 45 behavioral groups prescribed at points and Clause under Articles 8, 9, 11, 12, 21 and Article 26, Decree No. 34/CP of the Government.
Particularly for violations is a direct cause of traffic accidents, the fine level has increased very high, specifically: Violation of speed: an increase of 25%;Violation of avoidance regulations: increased from 40 -130%;Violation of regulations on roads and lanes: an increase of 33%;Violation of regulations on alcohol content: an increase of 150%;Violation of regulations on vehicle load: an increase of 66%;Violation of regulations on the number of passengers allowed to carry: increased from 25% to 100%;Violation of regulations on braking systems, redirection systems: an increase of 20%.
Thus, the level of fines for violations of traffic safety and order is currently very high, especially focusing on violations that are the direct cause of accidents and traffic congestion, showing the strict nature of the law, the implementation of sanctions has been effective, strongly impacting on the awareness of the traffic laws of the majority of traffic participants."
"In recent years, the Government, sectors and levels have taken many measures to reduce congestion and curb traffic accidents, but the situation still takes place in an increasing tendency, especially on holidays and New Year.Proposing the Government to direct ministries, branches and localities to further promote the propaganda and education in the people of all strata to raise awareness and sense of self-compliance with the law and inspect strictly handle violations of the law on traffic safety, especially the effective implementation of Decree 34/2010/ND-CP dated April 7, 2010 of the Government on the Regulation on administrative sanctions on the area of ​​the Ministry of Traffic (on the area of ​​the Ministry of Transport, which has been effective on the area of ​​the Ministry of Traffic, from May 20, 2010).","Facing the situation of complicated traffic order and safety, the Party and the State have focused on directing and proposing many guidelines and policies and gradually improving the legal system of traffic order and safety, specifically: The Secretariat issued Directive No. 22-CT/TW on strengthening the Party's leadership for the work of ensuring traffic order and traffic safety;The National Assembly passes the Law on Road Traffic, Vietnam Railway Law, Inland Waterway Law ...;The Government issued Resolution 13/NQ-CP, 32/NQ-CP on solutions to curb traffic accidents and traffic congestion.Annual or 6 months (when the situation of complicated traffic order and safety), the Government has directed the National Traffic Safety Committee to organize a national traffic safety conference with the composition of ministries, branches, local People's Committees, Departments of Transport, Director of local police and mass information agencies ... to assess the situation, the results of the task of ensuring the work of traffic safety and tasks.The ministries, branches and localities regularly have plans and electricity plans with many appropriate measures to solve, in particular attaching importance to propaganda and education to raise the awareness of self -compliance with the law on traffic order and safety and strictly handle violations of traffic order and safety.Therefore, the situation of traffic order and safety has gradually improved, traffic accidents decreased over the years, specifically:
Five cases of traffic accidents number of deaths
2006 14.318 12,190 10,930
2007 14,218 12,857 10,631
2008 12,163 11,318 7,855
2009 11,798 11,091 7,654
6T/2010 6,559 5,610 4,885
Regarding the implementation of Decree 34/2010/ND-CP of the Government: ministries, branches and localities, especially the Ministry of Public Security, has actively organized the implementation and issuance of documents instructing and organizing thoroughly and implementing.After 2 months, the Decree takes effect from May 20, 2010 compared to the previous two months of adjacent, the number of cases of violation handling increased by 141,965 cases, the fine increased by 53 billion;Compared to 2 months in the same period in 2009, the number of cases of sanctioning for a penalty increased by 197,233 cases, the fine increased by 55 billion.Thereby, the awareness of traffic participants initially has more positive, the situation of traffic order and safety has changed clearly;Propaganda and dissemination are focused;The violation is more seriously sanctioned, especially a number of violations that are the direct cause of traffic accidents and traffic congestion.This is a positive measure in ensuring traffic order and safety."
"Voters said that, with the sanctioning of violations of traffic order and safety today, it is still light, not enough to deter.The not appropriate penalty for violations is also the cause of disorder and traffic safety.It is recommended that the Ministry of Public Security should study amendments to the sanctioning regulations in the direction of getting worse than the sanctioning level for violations of traffic order and safety.","On April 2, 2010, the Government issued Decree No. 34/2010/ND-CP stipulating sanctioning administrative violations in the field of road traffic (effective from May 20, 2010).Accordingly, it has increased from 50% to 150% of the fine according to the fine frame at 83 of the 25 Article of the total of 123 of 34 articles in Decree 146/ND-CP before.Particularly for the inner city area of ​​special cities, the pilot regulations increased the fine of 1.3 times to 3 times for the same violation in other places (applied at 26 Clause under Articles 8, 9, 11, 12, 21, 26 of Decree No. 34/CP).Thus, the level of sanctioning by the form of fines for many violations of traffic order and safety has increased higher than before.
According to the provisions of the Ordinance on handling administrative violations, the authority to stipulate administrative violations and forms, the sanction level is the Government.In the process of implementing Decree 34/2010/ND-CP, if the actual requirements, the Ministry of Public Security will coordinate with relevant ministries and branches to propose the Government to amend and supplement regulations on sanctioning administrative violations in this field accordingly."
"The sanctions of the police sector when drivers of vehicles violating the Road Traffic Law, requesting the Government to consider the sanction of this field in the direction of increasing the fine level instead of temporarily seizing vehicles, especially motorcycles because there are many cases where households have only one vehicle as a vehicle, living and doing business mainly from households, if temporarily seized the vehicle, causing difficulties for people's activities.","According to the Government's Decree No. 34/2010/ND-CP of April 2, 2010, stipulating the sanctioning of administrative violations in the field of road traffic has restricted many cases of temporarily seizing vehicles.Article 54 of the Decree shall only stipulate the temporary seizure of vehicles for cases where violations are at risk of directly causing traffic accidents or endangered traffic participants or need time to check and verify the origin of vehicles (such as violations of using alcohol overcover, no driver's license, no vehicle papers ...);There are currently 23 cases of violations that are detained and the custody time has been shortened to 10 days (compared to many cases of custody to 30, 60, even 90 days).
The law also specifies the cases of temporary detention of administrative violations.According to the provisions of the Ordinance on handling of administrative violations and Decree No. 34/2010/ND-CP, the temporary seizure of administrative violations in order to immediately prevent violations of traffic order and safety is said to be dangerous to the operators of violating vehicles and for other traffic participants and ensure the sanctioning of administrative violations or verifying and investigating vehicles.Therefore, the temporary seizure of administrative violations in such cases ensures efficiency and legal effect, creating deterrent for violators rather than applying measures to increase the level of fines."
"Voters reflect the situation of rural traffic accidents increasing due to a number of young people driving motorbikes without complying with laws, with alcohol when driving the vehicle;The situation of the case running on a motor with horsepower on 10 CV operates on the river, causing the erosion of the canal and traffic accidents.Proposing the Government, the Ministry of Public Security and the authorities to have solutions to manage and handle the above vehicles: It is necessary to assign more authority to the commune police and increase the sanctioning level in many forms.","Along with the increasing rural economic life, the number of motorbikes, motorcycles, and engine covers with horsepower has more than 10 CVs increasing rapidly.However, the level of understanding, the awareness of traffic laws, the knowledge of vehicle control is limited, leading to a general traffic accident and rural areas.In order to overcome this situation, it is necessary to promote the propaganda, education and guidance on rural people to control vehicles in accordance with regulations and apply sanctions.Since 2007, the Ministry of Public Security has issued guidelines No. 1207/BCA-C11 on mobilizing the commune police force to participate in the task of ensuring traffic order and safety, which has stipulated the authority for the commune police to perform a number of tasks in ensuring traffic order and safety.In order to implement the 2008 Road Traffic Law, the Ministry of Public Security reported to the Government to promulgate Decree No. 27/2010/ND-CP dated March 24, 2010 on mobilizing other police forces and commune police to coordinate with the road traffic police to participate in patrol, control and road traffic safety in case of need;Decree No. 73/2009/ND-CP detailing the activities of the commune police;Decree No. 34/2010/ND-CP stipulating sanctioning administrative violations on road traffic.At the same time, in Circular No. 12/2010/TT-BCA of the Ministry of Public Security, specifying a number of articles of the Commune Police Ordinance and Decree No. 73/2009/ND-CP also stipulated that the commune police shall participate in coordination with the traffic police forces to ensure traffic order and safety in the commune.
Based on the above -mentioned legal documents and other relevant laws, the People's Committee and the commune police at all levels are responsible for organizing the implementation of the local traffic order and safety.Therefore, the commune police have full authority to handle violations in traffic activities.In case of arising problems, agencies, organizations and individuals promptly propose, propose and report to the competent authority to guide the implementation."
"Voters asked the traffic police when checking the vehicle papers, especially for passenger trucks to request the driver to directly give papers to the traffic police officers, not to help the vehicle to do it instead, so it is possible to detect operators of vehicles participating in traffic whether or not drinking alcohol or beer.","According to the Ministry of Public Security's Circular No. 60/2009/TT-BCA dated October 29, 2009, on the process of patrolling, controlling and handling administrative violations of the Road Traffic Police prescribed when controlling vehicles, officers and soldiers of the police are assigned to ask the driver to take safe measures, get off and produce relevant papers.Once the papers have been received (if any), the police officers and soldiers notify the drivers and the people in the car to know the reason for control, then perform the control of papers related to the driver and vehicle, the operating conditions of the vehicle and transport activities as prescribed.For cars carrying people of 24 seats or more, officers and soldiers on duty must be directly on the carrying of the person to check and detect violations of technical safety of vehicles, expiry date, drivers' age, fire prevention and fighting equipment, cases of cars that do not meet the conditions for passenger business.
Thus, according to the above provisions, all cases of vehicles are stopped checking, traffic police only work with drivers, not working with assistants.Regarding the control of the driver of the vehicle whether or not to drink alcohol or not, the Ministry of Public Security has directed the traffic police force to take professional measures to detect and handle violations in accordance with the law."
